This program is designed to process the result of a backup produced by
the barrybackup command line program. The result of such a backup is a tarball
at ~/.barry/backup/<PIN>/<PIN>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMSS>.tar.gz. Inside that tarball
is a directory named "Address Book" which contains a binary file for each
contact.

To run it, execute
  bbab2csv TARBALL
where TARBALL is the file generated by barrybackup. The resulting CSV will
be printed to STDOUT, and unrecognized data will be printed to STDERR.


The code is relatively simple, and adding new fields to be included in the
CSV is as easy as editing a bit of code near the top of the file. See the
comments in the file for more information.
